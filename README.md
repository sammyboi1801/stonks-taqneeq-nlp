# Stonks - Your friendly neighbourhood Stock Buddy :dizzy:

This is our solution to the problem statement for Cyber Cypher, 2023.

We came up with a web app where the user will enter a company name. Our application will predict closing, high and low prices using an LSTM model. 

Then, our application will look for news articles on the company. We pass multiple news headlines and descriptions into a NLP model which returns the sentiment regarding the news to give a final verdict regarding whether the user should buy the stock!
